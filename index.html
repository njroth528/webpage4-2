    Sometimes you gotta close a door to open a window<br>
    <br>
Woo<br>
I saw a photo, you looked joyous<br>
My eyes are green, I eat my veggies<br>
I need to get her out the picture<br>
She's really fuckin' up my frame<br>
She's not developed like we are<br>
<br>
Like magic, like magic, like magic, gone<br>
New magic, new magic, new magic wand<br>
Like magic, like magic, like magic, gone (nigga)<br>
New magic, new magic, new magic wand<br>
<br>
My brother said I'm on the spectrum<br>
Don't call me selfish, I ain't sharin'<br>
This 60-40 (isn't) workin'<br>
I want a hundred of your time, you're mine<br>

Please don't leave me now<br>
Please don't leave me now (Don't leave)<br>

You wanna be mean, mixed signals don't park (I can make her leave)<br>
She's gonna be dead, I just got a magic wand (Don't leave)<br>
We can finally be together<br>
<br>
You roll the dice, hit a seven, sure you right<br>
Beginner's luck, you not my first, who gives a fuck?<br>
Your other one evaporate, we celebrate<br>
You under oath, now pick a side and if you don't<br>
I'll pick you both (Run, run, run, run)<br>
(Run, run, run, run) It's not a joke<br>
Murder she wrote<br>
<br>
Ayo<br>
Take one look in the mirror, implications so clear<br>
I live life with no fear, except for the idea<br>
That one day you won't be here<br>
I will not fetch the ball<br>
Eyes are green, I eat my vegetables<br>
It has nothin' to do with that broad<br>
But if it did, guarantee she'd be gone, well<br>
I got a plan, 'bout to walk in the pen<br>
If you can't understand, I'm a hawk in the gym<br>
Eyes on the prize, got weight on my chest<br>
That I need to get off, or I ain't talkin' to them<br>
Can't be in the picture if it got no frame<br>
Gon' let the world know 'cause I ain't got no shame<br>
Blow the whole spot up, 'cause I ain't<br>
I wanna share last names, I wanna be your number one<br>
Not the other one, keep it on the low<br>
I'm in my right mind, keep it on a high<br>
Janis Joplin spillin' feelings, now I'm out here moppin' 'em<br>
Four on the floor, pack up your bags, we hit the store<br>
Grab our supplies, no need for masks, bust through the door<br>
Get the job done like retirement, I admit you look concerned<br>
New magic wand<br>

I see the light<br>
I see the light<br>
I see the light (don't touch, though, niggas might get buck, don't touch, though)<br>
I see the light (don't touch, though, niggas might get buck, don't touch, though)<br>
I see the light<br>
<br>
That car crash couldn't take me (woo, ha)<br>
Green hair angels all around me (uh)<br>
No answer why, no tears to cry, bitch, I'm alive (I see the)<br>
That wasn't my endpoint, like v-neck<br>
I ain't have nobody to cheat on, I cheat death<br>
New album, no repeat, I reset<br>
Everything I deliver swingin' like new jack<br>
Two of 'em, I total, Kim and Pam<br>
Me and Death, universe plays middle man<br>
Quit nap, kick back like horse, eyes shut<br>
Loud sound, no stretch<br>
Motherfuckers really thought I died<br>
Hoping they could take a spot<br>
Nigga not knowing that I'm one to one<br>
And they some Helen Keller-ass niggas<br>
And I got my eyes open now I see the<br>
Light<br>
<br>
I see the light<br>
(Woo)<br>
I see the light<br>
I see the light<br>
I see the light<br>
I don't know what's harder, letting go or just being okay with it<br>

    <h1 id="box10">GONE, GONE / THANK YOU</h1>
    Comparing scars before dinner<br>
Jump off the booth into the mirror<br>
Felt like summer<br>
To my December<br>
Was it my August?<br>
Shit, I don't remember<br>
(Two, three, go)<br>
I know my temperature was set<br>
You finally flew south<br>
The bird gon' leave the nest, it's so comedic<br>
At least I had it (uh)<br>
Instead of never<br>
Or maybe I'm too dramatic<br>
(Two, three, go)<br>
<br>
Whether it's rain or shine, I know I'm fine for now<br>
My love's gone, my love's gone<br>
My love's gone, oh, gone (two, three, go)<br>
Or maybe it's just a dream that I can't seem to wake up from<br>
My love's gone, my love's gone<br>
My love's gone, gone<br>
<br>
Gone, gone, gone, gone, gone<br>
<br>
I know love is all I got<br>
I just hope to God she got good taste<br>
Could put you on some shit you never seen<br>
Could play a couple songs that you could dance to<br>
I hope you know she can't compete with me<br>
<br>
Whether it's rain or shine, I know I'm fine for now<br>
My love's gone, my love's gone<br>
My love's gone, oh, gone<br>
Or maybe it's just a dream that I can't seem to wake up from<br>
My love's gone, my love's gone<br>
My love's gone, gone<br>
<br>
Kept it going, the Band-Aid is falling off now (Keep)<br>
Kept it going, the Band-Aid is falling off now (Keep)<br>
Keep it going, the Band-Aid is falling off now (Going)<br>
And now I'm scarred for life<br>
<br>
My love is gone (Gone), my love is gone (Gone)<br>
My love is gone (It's gone), my love is gone<br>
<br>
Ayo, there's poison in that gumbo<br>
Emotion for Dumbo<br>
Ask me where my luck go<br>
That bitch walked outside the front door<br>
Knock, knock, knock, knock<br>
I'm not shocked, I brought this on me<br>
It's my fault, you gon' leave<br>
Lesser talk, see the<br>
Weatherman told me it wasn't raining<br>
My stupid ass brought an umbrellas<br>
I got a glimpse of your cloud and feel better<br>
Now it's ninety degrees, and all the tricks up my sleeve<br>
Is drenched in sweat and illusion because I jet to conclusion<br>
You got your thing, I got nothing, but memories<br>
I know your secrets, nigga<br>
I'm not bitter or nothing, I understand that<br>
Everybody making a choice according to plan and<br>
We had two different blueprints, but understood her fluent<br>
She opened up early on, I thought I had a permit<br>
You started building a bridge and turned it into a fence<br>
Then my building got tore down all because of your new tenant<br>
I'll just buy up some new shit, never down with a lease<br>
You never lived in your truth, I'm just happy I lived in it<br>
But I finally found peace, so peace<br>
Lemme do it over<br>
(Where? Everything)<br>
<br>
I hate wasted potential, that shit crushes your spirit<br>
It really does, it crushes your soul<br>
<br>
Thank you for the love, thank you for the joy<br>
But I will never want to fall in love again<br>
Thank you for the time, thank you for your mind, oh<br>
But I don't ever want to fall in love again<br>
<br>
I said go, go<br>
<br>
Thank you for the love, thank you for the joy<br>
But I will never want to fall in love again (Again)<br>
Thank you for the time, thank you for your mind, oh<br>
But I don't ever want to fall in love again<br>
<br>
Again, again<br>
Again, again, again, again, again, again<br>
(Got my eye)<br>
